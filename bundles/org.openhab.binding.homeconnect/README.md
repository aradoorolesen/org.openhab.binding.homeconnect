# Home Connect Binding

The binding integrates the [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) system into openHAB.
By using the Home Connect API it connects to household devices from brands like Bosch and Siemens. 

Because all status updates and commands have to go through the API, a permanent internet connection is required.

## Supported Things

### Bridge

The __Home Connect API__ is responsible for the communication with the Home Connect API. All devices use a bridge to execute commands and listen for updates. Without a working bridge the devices cannot communicate.

### Devices

Supported devices: dishwasher, washer, washer / dryer combination, dryer, oven, refrigerator freezer, coffee machine, hood*, cooktop*

## Thing Configuration

### Configuring the __Home Connect API__ Bridge


#### 1. Preconditions

1. Please create an account at [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) and add your physical appliance to your account.
2. Test the connection to your physical appliance via mobile app ([Apple App Store (iOS) ](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/home-connect-app/id901397789?mt=8) or [Google Play Store (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bshg.homeconnect.android.release)).

#### 2. Create Home Connect developer account

1. Create an account at [https://developer.home-connect.com](https://developer.home-connect.com) and login.
2. Please make sure you've added your associated Home Connect account email at [https://developer.home-connect.com/user/me/edit](https://developer.home-connect.com/user/me/edit). You should fill in your email address, which you use for the official Android or iOS app, at `Default Home Connect User Account for Testing`.  
![Screenshot Home Connect profile page](doc/home_connect_profile.png "Screenshot Home Connect profile page")

3. Create an application at [https://developer.home-connect.com/applications](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications)
    * _Application ID_: e.g. `openhab-binding`
    * _OAuth Flow_: Authorization Code Grant Flow
    * _Home Connect User Account for Testing_: the associated user account email from [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/)  
     **_Please don't use your developer account username_**
    * _Redirect URIs_: add your openHAB URL followed by `/homeconnect`  
    for example: `http://192.168.178.34:8080/homeconnect` or `https://myhome.domain.com/homeconnect`
    * _One Time Token Mode_: keep unchecked 
    * _Proof Key for Code Exchange_: keep unchecked
    > **WARNING**: If you plan to add more than two Home Connect appliances, I suggest that you create multiple applications on the Home Connect developer site. Due to the request [limits](https://developer.home-connect.com/docs/general/ratelimiting)  this is necessary to avoid communication problems. Each Home Connect application is associated to a openHAB bridge.  
    It is also possible to add all home appliances to one bridge. But initializing will take longer after adding them or a openHAB restart. You will see log messages like this: `The rate limit “50 calls in 1 minute” was reached. Requests are blocked during the remaining period of 40 seconds.` 
4. After your application has been created, you should see the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ of the application. Please save these for later.  

![Screenshot Home Connect application page](doc/home_connect_application.png "Screenshot Home Connect application page")



#### 3. Setup bridge (Paper UI)

The Home Connect bridge can be configured in the Paper UI as follows:

1. Go to the Inbox and press the add button
2. Choose `Home Connect Binding`
3. Select `Home Connect API`
4. Enter
    * __client id:__ your application client id
    * __client secret:__ your application client secret
    * __simulator:__ false
5. Now navigate to the URL (`Redirct URI`) you've  added to your Home Connect application in the previous step (2.3). For example `http://192.168.178.80:8080/homeconnect`.
6. Please follow the steps shown to authenticate your binding. You can redo this step every time. For example if you have authentication problems, just start wizard again.  
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 1](doc/homeconnect_setup_1.png "Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 1")  
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 2](doc/homeconnect_setup_2.png "Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 2")  
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 3](doc/homeconnect_setup_3.png "Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 3")  
![Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 4](doc/homeconnect_setup_4.png "Screenshot Home Connect wizard page 4")  

7. That's it! Now you can use autodiscovery to add devices. Your devices should show up if you start a scan inside the Paper UI Inbox.

## Log view

The binding comes with a build in logging service. The user interface is reachable through the web browser http(s)://[YOUROPENHAB]:[YOURPORT]/homeconnectlogs (e.g. http://192.168.178.100:8080/homeconnectlogs). The logging UI allows to download a pseudominysed log file. Credentials and appliance IDs will be replaced. For example, the exported file can be used to ask for help in the community forum.

Log entries older than 49h will be automatically earased. To disable file logging you can switch it off in the bindings settings. 

## How To

### Notification on credential error

To get notified when your Home Connect credentials have been revoked or expired you can use the following rule to get notified. 

This can happen if 

* your openHAB instance was offline for a longer period or
* new terms weren't accepted or
* a technical problem occurred.

```java
rule "Offline check - Home Connect bridge"
when
    Thing "<thingUID>" changed
then
    val statusInfo = getThingStatusInfo("<thingUID>")
    val status = statusInfo.getStatus()
    val statusDetail = statusInfo.getStatusDetail()

    if ((status !== null) && (statusDetail !== null)) {
        logInfo("api_bridge", "Home Connect bridge status: " + status.toString() + " detail: " + statusDetail.toString())
        if (status.toString() == 'OFFLINE' && statusDetail.toString() == 'CONFIGURATION_PENDING') {
            logError("api_bridge", "Home Connect bridge offline.")
            // send push, email, ...
        }
    }
end
```

### Start program with custom settings

Currently, not all program options of a device are available as items in openHAB. For example, you cannot change the `Fill quantity` of a coffee maker program. If starting a program with custom setting is wished, you can send a special command to the item of type `basic_actions_state`.

> **INFO**: Only for advanced users. You need to know how to use the `curl` command. Alternatively you could use the REST UI to trigger the commands.

#### 1. Retrieve "special command" payload

You have a couple options to get the program settings payload. 

a) You could have a look at the Home Connect developer documentation (https://developer.home-connect.com/docs/) and create the payload on your own. 

b) You could have a look at the log UI and extract the payload from there. 

1. On the physical device, select your desired program with the appropriate options.
2. Send the command `selected` to the `basic_actions_state` channel item. This will trigger an API call to retrieve the current home appliance program settings. You can do it via `curl` command or use the REST UI of openHAB.     
*Curl example*:   
        ```shell
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: text/plain" --header "Accept: application/json" -d "selected" "http://localhost:8080/rest/items/homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state"
        ```  
*Please replace `item` and `server URL`* 

3. Open the log UI in your browser (http(s)://[YOUROPENHAB]:[YOURPORT]/homeconnectlogs) and search for the latest occurence of the string `/programs/selected`. Click on the log line and expand the entry. It should look like the following screenshot.
![Screenshot Home Connect log view](doc/homeconnect_log_selected.png "Screenshot Home Connect log view")

4. Copy the JSON payload. In a further step, this payload will be used to start the program.  
*extracted payload:* 

      ```JS 
      {"data":{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Program.Beverage.EspressoMacchiato","options":[{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.CoffeeTemperature","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.CoffeeTemperature.94C","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.BeanAmount","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.BeanAmount.Mild","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.FillQuantity","value":60,"unit":"ml"}]}}
      ```

#### 2. Start program

After you've extracted the desired program command, you can start your program via openHAB rule or through a `curl` command.

##### in rule

*Example rule:*

```java
rule "trigger program"
when
    Time cron "0 32 13 ? * * *"
then
    homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state.sendCommand('{"data":{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Program.Beverage.EspressoMacchiato","options":[{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.CoffeeTemperature","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.CoffeeTemperature.94C","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.BeanAmount","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.BeanAmount.Mild","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.FillQuantity","value":60,"unit":"ml"}]}}')
end
```

Please replace `homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state` with your item name (of channel type `basic_actions_state`).

##### via curl

*Example command:*

```bash
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: text/plain" --header "Accept: application/json" -d '{"data":{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Program.Beverage.EspressoMacchiato","options":[{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.CoffeeTemperature","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.CoffeeTemperature.94C","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.BeanAmount","value":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.EnumType.BeanAmount.Mild","unit":"enum"},{"key":"ConsumerProducts.CoffeeMaker.Option.FillQuantity","value":60,"unit":"ml"}]}}' "http://localhost:8080/rest/items/homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state"
```

Please replace `homeconnect_CoffeeMaker_BOSCH_HCS06COM1_B95E5103934D_basic_actions_state` with your item name (of channel type `basic_actions_state`).

## FAQ

### I can't start my oven via openHAB.

Some operations are not possible at the moment. You need to sign an "Additional Partner Agreement". Please have a look at:
https://developer.home-connect.com/docs/authorization/scope

### I can't switch remote start to on.

The channel of type `remote_start_allowance_state` is read only. You can only enable it directly on the physical appliance.

### In case of error...

Please check log UI (http(s)://[YOUROPENHAB]:[YOURPORT]/homeconnectlogs) and ask for help in the community forum or on github. Please download a pseudonymised log file and attach it to your question.

### Rate limit reached

If you plan to add more than two Home Connect appliances, I suggest that you create multiple applications on the Home Connect developer site. Due to the request [limits](https://developer.home-connect.com/docs/general/ratelimiting)  this is necessary to avoid communication problems. Each Home Connect application is associated to a openHAB bridge. 

After you've added a appliance you can switch the bridge at the thing configuration page.
